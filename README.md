# Hi, Iâ€™m Spence

Iâ€™m a computer science student at Virginia Tech ðŸ¦ƒ and an independent full-stack developer with a software & design studio named "Painter*s Tape Studios." Although I've been programming and loving computing since late 2019, I'm primarily focused on front-end design and UI/UX work professionally.  

If my projects are of any interestâ€”I'd love to chat over [email](mailto:steadman@vt.edu) or connect on [Linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/spencer-steadman/)!
